        <AboutSection>
          My <b>love for coding</b> started all the way in the 2013. At that time
          I have been making small JavaScript games with <code>jQuery</code> and
          sites made with WordPress for my Minecraft servers.
        </AboutSection>
        <AboutSection>
          In 2016, I have started to <b>think seriously about my passion</b>. My
          first encounter with professional web development environment was
          <code>React</code>. It was pure dark magic back then... But in my eyes
          you could see bright flame indicating <b>my fascination</b>.
        </AboutSection>
        <AboutSection>
          To this day you can see it. I still <b>love it</b> but even more!
