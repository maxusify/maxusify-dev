      <AboutSection>
        My <b>love for coding</b> started all the way in the 2013. At that time I
        have been making small JavaScript games with <code>jQuery</code> and sites
        made with WordPress for my Minecraft servers.

      <AboutSection>
        In 2016, I have started to <b>think seriously about my passion</b>. My
        first encounter with professional web development environment was
        <code>React</code>. It was pure dark magic back then... But in my eyes
        you could see bright flame indicating <b>my fascination</b>.

        toolkit.
