      <AboutSection>
        My passion for coding ignited back in 2013. During that period, I delved
        into creating small-scale JavaScript games using jQuery, alongside
        crafting websites utilizing WordPress tailored for my Minecraft servers.

        In 2016, I have started to <b>think seriously about my passion</b>. My
        first encounter with professional web development environment was
        <code>React</code>. It was pure dark magic back then... But in my eyes
        you could see bright flame indicating <b>my fascination</b>.
